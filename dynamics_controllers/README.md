## Dynamics Controllers

Package that implements controllers that add a "dynamic control layer" to
existing effort controllers.

The controllers contained in this package allow to take into account the
dynamics of a kinematic chain/tree and to perform Computed Torque Control.
Controllers are meant to operate in conjunction with existing controllers that
operate with `hardware_interface::EffortJointInterface`, which act as a
"*sub-controller*".
The command from the sub-controller - which would normally be an effort - is
instead interpreted as an acceleration and injected in the Inverse Dynamic Model
(IDM) of the mechanism, allowing to better compensate for the nonlinearity of
robots' Dynamic Models.

Currently, there exist two controllers: `KdlChainController` and
`KdlTreeController`.
They are both based on KDL's implementation of the Recursive Newton-Euler
algorithm for the inverse dynamics.



### Gravity Compensation vs Full Inverse Dynamics

By default, the controllers perform full Inverse Dynamics computations.
However, you can ask them to perform gravity compensation only.
In this case, the command evaluated by the sub-controller is added to the
gravitational efforts - this corresponds to assuming the Generalized Inertia
Matrix to be the Identity and Coriolis/Centrifugal efforts to be null.

To enable gravity compensation only, you can specify the parameter
`gravity_compensation_only: true` in the controller configuration.



### Example of Controller Configuration

Assuming that you have a simple kinematic chain with two joints `joint1` and
`joint2`, you might have some controllers configured as:

```yaml
position_controller:
  type: effort_controllers/JointGroupPositionController
  joints:
    - joint1
    - joint2
  joint1/pid: {p: 10.0, i: 0.0, d: 5.0}
  joint2/pid: {p: 10.0, i: 0.0, d: 5.0}

velocity_controller:
  type: effort_controllers/JointGroupVelocityController
  joints:
    - joint1
    - joint2
  joint1/pid: {p: 10.0, i: 0.0, d: 5.0}
  joint2/pid: {p: 10.0, i: 0.0, d: 5.0}
```

To use the new controllers, you can change it, *e.g.*, as follows:
```yaml
gravity: [0, 0, -9.81] # this should be projected on the base frame

position_controller:
  type: dynamics_controllers/KdlChainController
  sub_controller:
    # the subcontroller is basically the controller you had before!
    type: effort_controllers/JointGroupPositionController
    joints:
      - joint1
      - joint2
    joint1/pid: {p: 10.0, i: 0.0, d: 5.0}
    joint2/pid: {p: 10.0, i: 0.0, d: 5.0}

velocity_controller:
  type: dynamics_controllers/KdlTreeController
  sub_controller:
    # the subcontroller is basically the controller you had before!
    type: effort_controllers/JointGroupVelocityController
    joints:
      - joint1
      - joint2
    joint1/pid: {p: 10.0, i: 0.0, d: 5.0}
    joint2/pid: {p: 10.0, i: 0.0, d: 5.0}
```

Note that you will likely have to tune again the gains of the sub-controllers to
achieve good performances.

#### Detailed Controllers Description

Below, parameters relative to each controller are listed.
Those marked as "searched for" can live in any parent namespace since the
`NodeHandle::searchParam` method is used to locate them.
This facilitates "sharing" common parameters such as the gravity vector, which
should not depend on a specific controller (at least in principle!).

##### KdlChainController

- `sub_controller`: should contain the configuration of a controller of type
  compatible with `EffortJointInterface`.
- `robot_description`: should contain the URDF of the robot. Searched for.
- `gravity`: list with three elements, representing the gravity vector in the
  base frame of the chain. Searched for. Default: `[0,0,0]`.
- `chain_base`: base of the chain. Searched for. Default: name of the root link
  from the robot description.
- `chain_tip`: tip of the chain. Searched for. Default: if a single "branch"
  is rooted at `base_link`, `chain_tip` will correspond to the last link of the
  chain. If at any point multiple children are found, loading will fail.
- `gravity_compensation_only`: as discussed above. Default: `false`.

##### KdlTreeController

- `sub_controller`: should contain the configuration of a controller of type
  compatible with `EffortJointInterface`.
- `robot_description`: should contain the URDF of the robot. Searched for.
- `gravity`: list with three elements, representing the gravity vector in the
  base frame of the chain. Searched for. Default: `[0,0,0]`.
- `tree_root`: base of the tree. Searched for. Default: name of the root link
  from the robot description. **NOTE**: currently, the parameter is ignored
  and the generated tree is always rooted at the base of the URDF.
- `gravity_compensation_only`: as discussed above. Default: `false`.



### Limitations

There are some limitations for these controllers:
- They all assume a static base. The main implication is that you cannot
  "serially join" controllers for different parts of the robot.
- They require proper identification of the Dynamic Parameters.
- The parameters must be provided in URDF format. This is a limitation since
  the identification will often return a smaller set of regrouped parameters.
- The sub-controller must control all joints of the internal `Chain`/`Tree`.



### Possible Improvements

- [ ] Compensation of external payloads, mainly in two ways:
    - By adding a subscriber that can update the `wrenches_` members
    - Allowing to dynamically modify the `Chain`/`Tree` instances
- [ ] Support for moving bases. This likely requires to re-implement the
      controllers using another library, such as pinocchio, or to expand KDL.
- [ ] Additional parameters such as joint inertia and viscous friction.
- [ ] Allow multiple sub-controllers to manage different joints.


### Personal todo list:

- How should the license be pasted? Some headers contain only WillowGarage,
  some many institutions. Should I put myself?
- Check CMakeLists.txt (install targets etc)
- Tell about the KDL version that is needed!
- Add documentation as in other packages
